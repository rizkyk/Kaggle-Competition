## Titanic Kaggle Competition

The Kaggle competition asks you to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic crash. You are given two datasets (Train & Test) each of which include predictor variables such as Age, Passenger Class, Sex, etc. With these two data sets we will do the following:

1) Create a model which will predict whether a passenger survived using only the Train data set
2) Predict whether the passengers survived in the Test data set based on the model we created

## Steps to follow

- Data Exploration
- Data Cleaning
- Training Model
- Fitting the Model

## Data Exploration


```{r}
summary(train)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
